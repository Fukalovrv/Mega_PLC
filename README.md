# This is an Arduino based, modular Industrial PLC

## I have designed this PLC back in 2016. It is currently in use in an industrial screw tightening robot:
- 4 stepper motors for X, Y, Z axes and for screw tightening
- Matrix keyboard
- I2C LCD
- Digital I/O in use for pneumatic screw feeding system an reference switches

## Features:
- Works wit an Arduino MEGA or DUE
- 16 24V, 500mA PNP digital outputs, optoinsulated, short circuit protected
- 16 24V PNP digital inputs, optoinsulated
- Stepper board for 4 stepper motors
- Slot for communication board (I2C, CAN, SPI, 2x Serial)
- Slot for analog board (Analog in, PWM, DAC, I2C)
